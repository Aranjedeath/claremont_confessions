(He prefers the term \"homemaker\"). He taught me how to use a table saw and bake chocolate chip cookies. He served on PTA and led my middle school reading circles.  He built my sister and I the most badass pink playhouse you could imagine in your wildest dreams!  My mom was the lawyer who brought home the proverbial bacon (my dad brought home literal bacon because he did the grocery shopping). He is a wonderful parent as is my mother, and I was lucky enough to grow up in a gender flip-flopped household and I remained entirely unconscious of its rarity until I hit middle school. So as for the sheer concept of being a stay at home dad, hell yeah! It can be great for the whole family and in this day and age I'm sure even more people would be willing to try an atypical family set up. However a word of caution: in this description, you make this  theoretical man sound like your pet! Or perhaps a maid. A \"kept\" man is very different than a husband and partner. My parents relationship worked because they are BOTH devoted to each other. Because they BOTH provide for each other, be it financially or emotionally.  A good relationship is fundamentally a partnership of equals and if you can maintain that, than whether or not one of you (male, female, plant, or mineral) decides to stay home it can be a positive experience! But always remember, there is more than one way to \"provide\" in a relationship and NEVER  underestimate how long it takes to clean a house, especially if your got little rugrats running around. (Kids are mysteriously sticky 90% of the time). Good luck in life and love! Stay open to options! Be flexible! And be responsive to your partner's needs!

I can even believe it. You’ve never raped anybody. You would NEVER rape anybody. You’re upset that all these feminists are trying to accuse you of doing something or connect you to doing something that, as far as you’re concerned, you’ve never done and would never condone.\n\nAnd they’ve told you about triggers, and PTSD, and how one in six women is a survivor, and you get it. You do. But you can’t let every time someone gets all upset get in the way of you having a good time, right?\n\nSo fine. If all those arguments aren’t going anything for you, let me tell you this. And I tell you this because I genuinely believe you mean it when you say you don’t want to hurt anybody, and you don’t see the harm, and that it’s important to you to do your best to be a decent and good person. And I genuinely believe you when you say you would never associate with a rapist and you think rape really is a very bad thing.\n\nBecause this is why I refuse to take rape jokes sitting down-\n\n6% of college age men, slightly over 1 in 20, will admit to raping someone in anonymous surveys, as long as the word “rape” isn’t used in the description of the act.\n\n6% of Penny Arcade’s target demographic will admit to actually being rapists when asked.\n\nA lot of people accuse feminists of thinking that all men are rapists. That’s not true. But do you know who think all men are rapists?\n\nRapists do.\n\nThey really do. In psychological study, the profiling, the studies, it comes out again and again.\n\nVirtually all rapists genuinely believe that all men rape, and other men just keep it hushed up better. And more, these people who really are rapists are constantly reaffirmed in their belief about the rest of mankind being rapists like them by things like rape jokes, that dismiss and normalize the idea of rape.\n\nIf one in twenty guys is a real and true rapist, and you have any amount of social activity with other guys like yourself, really cool guy, then it is almost a statistical certainty that one time hanging out with friends and their friends, playing Halo with a bunch of guys online, in a WoW guild, or elsewhere, you were talking to a rapist. Not your fault. You can’t tell a rapist apart any better than anyone else can. It’s not like they announce themselves.\n\nBut, here’s the thing. It’s very likely that in some of these interactions with these guys, at some point or another someone told a rape joke. You, decent guy that you are, understood that they didn’t mean it, and it was just a joke. And so you laughed.\n\nAnd, decent guy who would never condone rape, who would step in and stop rape if he saw it, who understands that rape is awful and wrong and bad, when you laughed?\n\nThat rapist who was in the group with you, that rapist thought that you were on his side. That rapist knew that you were a rapist like him. And he felt validated, and he felt he was among his comrades.\n\nYou. The rapist’s comrade.\n\nAnd if that doesn’t make you feel sick to your stomach, if that doesn’t make you want to throw up, if that doesn’t disturb you or bother you or make you feel like maybe you should at least consider not participating in that kind of humor anymore…\n\nWell, maybe you aren’t as opposed to rapists as you claim.”\n\n- via a comment on shakesville.com","created_time":"2014-03-29T06:12:32+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"551084894","name":"Rebecca Nathan"},{"id":"749552011","name":"Claire Murphy"},{"id":"1129411348","name":"Nicole Pilar"},{"id":"882630342","name":"Catherine Chiang"},{"id":"525105846","name":"Celeste Melamed"},{"id":"1488109478","name":"Wendy Johana Noreña"},{"id":"1313356439","name":"Alisa Tang"},{"id":"1021529500","name":"Rebecca Streitz"},{"id":"100001528364101","name":"Alexandria Gonzales"},{"id":"642033997","name":"Shalina Omar"},{"id":"100002248832289","name":"Kathleen Kohl"},{"id":"545897915","name":"Amy Frances Brown"},{"id":"551512426","name":"Mary Kamitaki"},{"id":"100000052012161","name":"Johnny Le"},{"id":"1067892795","name":"Kacey Hopson"},{"id":"501960585","name":"Tasha Block"},{"id":"605701257","name":"Paula Ning"},{"id":"100000189990047","name":"Sophia Rosenthal"},{"id":"1389432153","name":"Nicole Parissa"},{"id":"1805788753","name":"Dean Shim"},{"id":"1355439487","name":"Teresa Rose Osborne"},{"id":"100004613462572","name":"Becca Marx"},{"id":"632008497","name":"Lia Metzger"},{"id":"666766483","name":"Lizzie Indra Kumar"},{"id":"1082494330","name":"James Marzuola Waller"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTA4MjQ5NDMzMA==","before":"NTUxMDg0ODk0"},"next":"https://graph.facebook.com/1382466625325701_1384375785134785/likes?access_t…gtFZC7ZCxuWBZBgFck1G3X0buZC2cTGLwQZDZD&limit=25&after=MTA4MjQ5NDMzMA%3D%3D"}}},{"message":"Sometimes I feel like the lone socially awkward fish in the Claremont McKenna sea of socially adept/normal people","created_time":"2014-03-29T06:11:43+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1035536766","name":"Hunter Charles Reardon"},{"id":"100002485637389","name":"Lawrence Beall"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyNDg1NjM3Mzg5","before":"MTAzNTUzNjc2Ng=="}}}},{"message":"[Depression]\n\nIt's been half a year and here I am, still depressed and obsessed with you.

It has caused a good deal of tension in the suite, and my suite mate's girlfriend is now uncomfortable visiting. \nThe first time I brought this up with him he started crying, so I am afraid to confront him again.

I want to participate, but at first just hang out with them so I can feel comfortable being around other people who express themselves.\n If anyone can tell me more I would greatly appreciate it. I heard of the motherfucker party but I was not able to go, plus don't like to drink so I don't go to parties often, but I love interacting with people, so if anyone can tell me about more opportunities, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you, and I am so glad to be a newer student at the Claremont Colleges, loving it.","created_time":"2014-03-20T00:16:49+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"1308570483","name":"Eva Byrne"},{"id":"783315117","name":"Olivia Lark"},{"id":"1010636249","name":"Sunny Jeong"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAxMDYzNjI0OQ==","before":"MTMwODU3MDQ4Mw=="}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"1383835191855511_4745","from":{"id":"783315117","name":"Olivia Lark"},"message":"naphinaphinaphinaphinaphinaphinaphinaphinaphinaphi","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-23T07:13:39+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"1383835191855511_4706","from":{"id":"669840106","name":"Dinu Duri"},"message":"The Wash!","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T16:23:10+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"1383835191855511_4707","from":{"id":"669840106","name":"Dinu Duri"},"message":"Or any other Naphi sponsored event, I think you'll find what you're looking for :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-03-22T16:26:31+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MQ==","before":"Mw=="}}}},{"message":"I only have 3 friends.
